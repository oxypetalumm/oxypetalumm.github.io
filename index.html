  “Some people make things happen. Some people watch things happen. And then there are those who wonder, 'What the hell just happened?”
― Carroll Bryant
</p>
<p>
  “you can't say "if this didn't happen then that would have happened" because you don't know everything that might have happened.You might think something'd be good, but for all you know, it could have turned out horrible. You can't say "If only I'd ..." because you could be wishing for anything. The point is, you'll never know. You've gone past. So there's no use thinking about it. So I don't”
― Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies
